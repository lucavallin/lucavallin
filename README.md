## Hello! üëã

Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I build distributed systems and infrastructure tooling, improving how teams deploy and scale cloud-native workloads. I'm especially interested in Go, Kubernetes, networking, containers, and observability. I also maintain a strong interest in emerging technologies like Rust, eBPF, and WebAssembly for their potential to improve performance, security, and portability.

Beyond my primary expertise, I've branched out into areas like frontend development with React and TypeScript, data engineering and Google Cloud to name a few. My past also saw me wearing the hats of a consultant, delivering hands-on training sessions, hosting podcasts, and organizing meetups for the tech community. I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by my blog posts and talks. Additionally, I hold the title of [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/lucacavallin) and [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/61b3062f-ded7-425f-8363-e11c13a601de/public_url).

For a deeper dive into my contributions, head over to [my blog](https://lucavall.in). For those new to open source, consider exploring [Verto.sh](https://verto.sh). And if you're on the lookout for mentorship, I offer guidance on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Outside of work, activities like [photography](https://lucavall.in/photography), cycling, cooking on a kamado and cleaning litterboxes keep me occupied üêà.
