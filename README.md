## Hello! üëã

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

I am passionate about distributed systems, developer and infrastructure tools, Linux, networking and system-level programming in general. I enjoy working in the Cloud Native space with technologies like Go, Rust, Azure, Kubernetes and I share my knowledge through blog posts and talks. These contributions to the community have earned me a few recognitions, including becoming a Google Developer Expert (GDE). I am currently learning more about AI and when I'm looking for some extra fun, I tinker with data and related "creative-coding" projects.

Back in 2015, I made the move from Italy to The Netherlands. Since then, I've been diving into all sorts of projects, wearing different hats along the way. Besides my main skills and interests, I've also jumped into areas like .NET, TypeScript, REST APIs, several databases, Google Cloud, Data Engineering, consultancy, giving trainings, hosting meetups and podcasts, and more.

Check out [my blog](https://cavall.in) for my articles and talks, [FirstIssue.dev](https://firstissue.dev) to find a project for your next open-source contribution, or hire me as your mentor on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/)! The rest of my time is spent cycling, cooking on a kamado, stargazing and cleaning litterboxes üêà.
