## Hello! üëã

Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I am passionate about (building) developer and infrastructure tools, with expertise in Go, Kubernetes, and the Cloud Native domain. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Rust, systems- and network-programming.

Beyond my primary expertise, I've branched out into areas like .NET, React, TypeScript, APIs, data engineering and Google Cloud to name a few. My past also saw me wearing the hats of a consultant, delivering hands-on training sessions, hosting podcasts, and organizing engaging meetups for the tech community. I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by my blog posts and talks. Additionally, I hold the title of [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/lucacavallin) and [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/61b3062f-ded7-425f-8363-e11c13a601de/public_url).

For a deeper dive into my contributions, head over to [my blog](https://lucavall.in). For those new to open source, consider exploring [Verto.sh](https://verto.sh). And if you're on the lookout for mentorship, I offer guidance on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Outside of work, activities like [photography](https://lucavall.in/photography), cycling, cooking on a kamado and cleaning litterboxes keep me occupied üêà.
