### Hello! 👋

I am a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub with over ten years of experience in software development. My niche is in building cloud native distributed systems, developer and infrastructure tools, and I find systems internals and networking particularly exciting. 

I have a passion for Go, Rust, Azure and contributing to open-source libraries and devops tooling using them.

I used to give trainings and talks about Google Cloud and I was quite good at it, but these days I am more interested in diving into the bytes than talking about them - check below the certifications I took and the talks I have given for a glimpse of the past! On the topic of trainings, over the years I have taken a few on a variety of topics such as SRE and Agile methodologies to support my engineering skills. I believe it's important to have a good overview of what is going on in the field at large!

The rest of the my time I enjoy cycling, cooking on a kamado, astronomy and playing with my cats 🐈.
