## Hello! üëã

Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I focus on platform engineering - building distributed systems and the infrastructure and networking tooling behind reliable, observable cloud-native workloads. I work primarily in Go across Kubernetes, containers, networking, and end-to-end observability. I'm interested in Rust and eBPF as a path to safer, higher-throughput platforms with kernel-level insight and control. I‚Äôm also exploring AI engineering and its applications in this space.

Beyond my primary expertise, I've branched out into areas like frontend development with React and TypeScript, data engineering and Google Cloud to name a few. My past also saw me wearing the hats of a consultant, delivering hands-on training sessions, hosting podcasts, and organizing meetups for the tech community. I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by my blog posts and talks. Additionally, I hold the title of [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/lucacavallin) and [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/61b3062f-ded7-425f-8363-e11c13a601de/public_url).

For a deeper dive into my contributions, head over to [my blog](https://lucavall.in). For those new to open source, consider exploring [Verto.sh](https://verto.sh). And if you're on the lookout for mentorship, I offer guidance on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Outside of work, activities like [photography](https://lucavall.in/photography), motorcycling, playing a handpan and cleaning litterboxes keep me occupied üêà.
