### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer with full-stack experience ranging from distributed systems to cross-platform apps. I am currently interested in building serverless solutions on Google Cloud using Golang, Rust and React and all the bells and whistles of SRE (and Agile!) practices. I give trainings on Cloud Engineering too.

Check out my blog posts on the Binx.ioâ€™s blog, the podcast I host with my friendly colleague Jacco Kulman and then go join GCP User Group meetup we organize with Google Cloud!

The rest of the time I go for some cycling, cuddle my cats and enjoy 3D modeling with Blender.

> Are you a software engineer and do you think you could use some personal/career advice? Reach out and I'll be happy have a chat ;)
