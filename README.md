## Hello! 👋

Senior Platform Engineer at [Xebia](https://xebia.com). I focus on platform engineering, building distributed systems and the infrastructure and networking tooling behind reliable, observable cloud-native workloads. I work primarily in Go and Google Cloud across Kubernetes, containers, networking, and end-to-end observability. I'm interested in Rust and eBPF as a path to safer, higher-throughput platforms with kernel-level insight and control. I’m also exploring AI engineering and its applications in this space.

Beyond the technical stack, I am active in consulting, delivering hands-on training, hosting podcasts, and organizing meetups. My background includes React/TypeScript frontends and data engineering. I contribute to open source and share what I learn through blog posts and talks. I'm a [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/lucacavallin) and a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/61b3062f-ded7-425f-8363-e11c13a601de/public_url).

For a deeper dive, see [my blog](https://lucavall.in). If you're new to open source, check out [verto.sh](https://verto.sh). For mentorship, I'm on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Outside of work, activities like [photography](https://lucavall.in/photography), motorcycling, playing a handpan and cleaning litterboxes keep me occupied 🐈.
