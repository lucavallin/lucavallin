## Hello! üëã
![cover_lucavallin](https://github.com/lucavallin/lucavallin/assets/14332663/7e430e1d-5fd2-476b-a6e7-10058baf5150)

As a Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), I have a deep-rooted passion for developer and infrastructure tools, distributed systems, system-level programming involving Linux and networking. My expertise primarily revolves around Go, Rust, Kubernetes, serverless architectures and the Cloud Native domain in general.

Beyond my primary expertise, I've branched out into areas like .NET, React, TypeScript, APIs, data engineering and Google Cloud to name a few. My past also saw me wearing the hats of a consultant, delivering hands-on training sessions, hosting podcasts, and organizing engaging meetups for the tech community. I'm an active contributor to open source and believe in the importance of knowledge sharing, as evidenced by my blog posts and talks. Additionally, I hold the title of Google Developer Expert (GDE).

For a deeper dive into my contributions, head over to [my blog](https://lucavall.in). For those new to open source, consider exploring [Verto.sh](https://verto.sh). And if you're on the lookout for mentorship, I offer guidance on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Away from the screen, my time is spent cycling, cooking on a kamado, stargazing, or attending to my feline companions üêà.
