### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a Software Engineer and trainer with full-stack experience ranging from distributed systems to cross-platform apps. I am currently busy building cloud-native, serverless solutions on Google Cloud with Go and some Rust, and I help to implement SRE and Agile best practices. Sometimes I contribute to open source too.

The rest of the time you can find me on my race bike or cuddling my cats.
