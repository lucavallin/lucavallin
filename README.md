## Hello! üëã

Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I focus on platform engineering - building distributed systems and the infrastructure and networking tooling behind reliable, observable cloud-native workloads. I work primarily in Go across Kubernetes, containers, networking, and end-to-end observability. I'm interested in Rust and eBPF as a path to safer, higher-throughput platforms with kernel-level insight and control. I‚Äôm also exploring AI engineering and its applications in this space.

Beyond my core focus, I‚Äôve worked in React/TypeScript frontends, data engineering and Google Cloud. Previously I consulted, delivered hands-on training, hosted podcasts, and organized meetups. I contribute to open source and share what I learn through blog posts and talks. I‚Äôm a [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/lucacavallin) and a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/61b3062f-ded7-425f-8363-e11c13a601de/public_url).

For a deeper dive, see [my blog](https://lucavall.in). If you're new to open source, check out [Verto.sh](https://verto.sh). For mentorship, I'm on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/lucacavallin/). Outside of work, activities like [photography](https://lucavall.in/photography), motorcycling, playing a handpan and cleaning litterboxes keep me occupied üêà.
