### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Cloud Consultant at [https://binx.io](Binx.io).

I am a software engineer with full-stack experience ranging from large-scale distributed systems to client-facing web and mobile apps, and a fan of maintainable, testable, scalable software. I believe the cloud helps greatly when it comes to building applications painlessly, so he decided to dive deep into the wonderful world of Google Cloud. Furthermore I am a certified Product Owner, with a good understanding of UI/UX design principles.

The rest of the time I enjoy photography, cycling and cats.
