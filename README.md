### 👋 Hello! I am a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub (Actions). 

I have a passion for distributed systems, which I apply to the world of DevOps tooling and cloud infrastructure. So much so that I like to contribute to open source Go- and Rust-based projects in this space when time allows. I used to be into getting Google Cloud certifications and giving trainings and talks about it - check below for a glimpse of the past!

Check out my blog at: https://cavall.in (currently in maintenance).

The rest of my time is spent cycling, cooking on a kamado, playing guitar, stargazing and cleaning litterboxes 🐈.
