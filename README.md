### Hello ðŸ‘‹
Software Engineer, Cloud Architect at [Binx.io](https://binx.io).

I am a Software Engineer with full-stack experience ranging from distributed systems to cross-platform web/mobile apps. At the moment, I want to build serverless thingies on Google Cloud and I am interested in Golang, IoT & Data, React and Rust.

I write of cloud-native development and therewith help other engineers with the blog posts I publish on Binx.io's blog. Check out our talks too, or the podcast I host with Jacco Kulman, or the GCP User Group meetup we organize with Google Cloud!

The rest of the time I take pictures and edit them, go for some cycling, get scratched by my cats because thatâ€™s how cats are. I am also looking into CG with Blender because photography in NL gets boring fast.
