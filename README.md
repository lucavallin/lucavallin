### Hello! 👋

I am a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub with over ten years of experience in software development. My niche is in building cloud native distributed systems, developer and infrastructure tools, and I find systems internals and networking particularly exciting. 

I have a passion for Go, Rust, Azure and contributing to open-source libraries and devops tooling using them.
The rest of the my time I enjoy cycling, cooking on a kamado, astronomy and playing with my cats 🐈.
